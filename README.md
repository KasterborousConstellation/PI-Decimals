# BBP formula

Implementation of the [Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey%E2%80%93Borwein%E2%80%93Plouffe_formula) in `C`.

## Project idea

We are two French students, in Lyc√©e Hoche (Versailles), and we decided to test our limits. As we love the number $\pi$, we searched for a way to calculate its decimals.

Most of the existing algorithms require a powerful computer, with a lot of computational power, or memory.

We do not have that.

So here comes the Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe formula, which makes it possible, to only calculate a specific digit, without computing all of the previous ones.

## Commands

This project uses `make` commands to build and use the project.

As such, the following commands are usable:
* `calculator`: builds the calculator and test its speed to calculate the first N-th digits
* `converter`: builds the converter and test it on the first N-th digits
* `client`: builds the server client
* `server`: build the server backend part
* `clean`: deletes all build files
* `tarball`: ouputs a tar archive with all the code
* `format`: formats all `.c` and `.h` files following the Linux conventions

## Project architecture

The project can be cut down in smaller modules. They are all inter-connected, but are built apart to sustain a more maintainable architecture.

### Calculator

This is the implementation of the BBP formula in C. This is where all the _magic_ takes place.

Usage: you call the `pi()` function from `calculator/algorithm/algorithm.c`.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#include "calculator/algorithm/algorithm.h"

int main() {
    printf("The 1000th digit in base 16 is %ld\n.", pi(1000));
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

**Please note**: the algorithm returns the digit in base 16. It is the role of the next module to convert it either to a base 16 string, or to the decimal base.
